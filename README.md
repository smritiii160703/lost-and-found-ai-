## 🚩 Problem

Students frequently lose ID cards, books, headphones, umbrellas, etc.  
Information is scattered across WhatsApp groups and notice boards — there is no central system.

> Result: items remain lost, time is wasted, frustration increases.

## 🎯 Solution

A simple AI assistant where students can:

✔ Upload a **Lost** or **Found** item  
✔ Add description + location  
✔ Attach an image  
✔ Get AI-suggested matches automatically  

Admins can later mark items as **returned**.
